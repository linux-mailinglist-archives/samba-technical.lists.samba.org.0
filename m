Hi,

I've been spending some time untangling what it actually means to be
compatible with 2012 R2. I've been writing a wiki page this week because
there is hardly any information about this:

https://wiki.samba.org/index.php?title=Windows_2012_Server_compatibility

I'm still working on adding some more detail, but I should be done in
the next few days.Â 

Really one of the complications in saying what we're compatible with is
certain features which we do or do not implement. From an AD perspective
in terms of functional level, we're about 2008 R2, but there's still
things we're missing from that like managed service accounts (MSA),
recycling bin, trusts, DFSR etc. Functional levels in MS-AD are normally
in lock-step and version the entire directory, so we're basically our
own thing.

In terms of FSMO roles, I expect we handle the RID master role
adequately, the schema master to a reasonable extent and likely most
2008 R2 (functional level) relevant parts for the PDC. As long as the
domain is at 2008 R2 functional level, it shouldn't matter what versions
of Windows are interacting with it. However, partition creation in Samba
for domain naming master doesn't work properly and so there shouldn't be
any code for that and infrastructure master concerns multi-domain
forests which we have only partial support for (and we haven't sorted
out recycling bin which also appears affected). Leaving these roles to
Samba even on a 2008 R2-only domain, with trusts, is unlikely to work as
expected.

Joining a 2012 R2 Windows DC to Samba without too much hassle is now
supposed to work for the first time (although I just found a new
regression, see https://bugzilla.samba.org/show_bug.cgi?id=14029).
Although we've updated the schema version defaults, we haven't updated
the preparation version defaults which are also still required (and
still needs more testing at this point).

Cheers,

Garming
