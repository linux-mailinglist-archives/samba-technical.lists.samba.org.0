Hi everybody - thank you for helping and for all the good advice! I will 
certainly look into it and take on board as soon I get the chance to 
address the issues - at the moment it is simply a question of making 
this work at a basic level, regrettably.

As it turned out, there was a configuration mistake on the LDAP server, 
so the domain/workgroup smbd was looking for, was empty; the name was 
wrong on the server side. After fixing that things are now working and I 
can move towards persuading people about making sensible improvements.

Thanks again!

Jan
