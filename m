Certainly now is the time to be doing deprecation.  This option has had
other consequences, with some clients reporting massive 'in use' sizes
for short files, to the confusion of our users.

Deprecation is harmless, so we should do at least that, and changing
the default back is user-visible but at least recoverable (while the
option still exists).  Perhaps we should be fixing the bug above also,
that seems quite wrong, but it is a matter of resources (pardon the
pun).
