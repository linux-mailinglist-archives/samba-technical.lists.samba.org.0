We could at least close another 100 bugs if we closed out bugs that are
open, not waiting for Karolin but referenced in a git commit.  

Currently these bugs have a BUG: tag in master yet are open[1]:

https://bugzilla.samba.org/buglist.cgi?bug_id=8630%2C9976%2C10066%2C10286%2C10440%2C10803%2C10812%2C10882%2C11012%2C11198%2C11592%2C11600%2C11628%2C11665%2C11823%2C11836%2C11894%2C12155%2C12292%2C12293%2C12297%2C12385%2C12399%2C12402%2C12416%2C12423%2C12451%2C12468%2C12739%2C12761%2C12841%2C12845%2C12851%2C12876%2C12881%2C12921%2C12926%2C13004%2C13039%2C13059%2C13093%2C13151%2C13159%2C13178%2C13213%2C13214%2C13223%2C13225%2C13229%2C13247%2C13307%2C13309%2C13311%2C13343%2C13350%2C13353%2C13365%2C13378%2C13379%2C13381%2C13415%2C13442%2C13448%2C13452%2C13458%2C13461%2C13462%2C13466%2C13469%2C13471%2C13475%2C13525%2C13564%2C13565%2C13573%2C13591%2C13604%2C13612%2C13627%2C13630%2C13655%2C13658%2C13680%2C13698%2C13699%2C13723%2C13761%2C13771%2C13772%2C13806%2C13822%2C13825%2C13843%2C13852%2C13864%2C13880%2C13915%2C13932%2C13939%2C13948%2C13949%2C13952%2C13959%2C13967%2C13973&bug_id_type=anyexact&list_id=22103&query_format=advanced

What do folks think of closing those as fixed?  Would someone be
willing to write a script to find the git hash from the BUG number and
close the bug with that and the version it was found in?  

Or should we just close them all in bulk (perhaps a more refined list)?
 
Of course, anyone actively doing a backport can just re-open them when
needed.

We would get a nicer outcome if we did it manually, and the manual
process I use would be (eg):

git log --grep="BUG: https://bugzilla.samba.org/show_bug.cgi?id=10000"

(guess which version it is in)
git log origin/v4-10-test

/3e11421e7476d968a3d550491279d0ad6b6c398f
(to search for the git hash)
then search trees until it is both found and not found, record that as
the fixed version.  Perhaps a smarter script could checkout the hash
and check the VERSION. 

Close the bug as RESOLVED/FIXED with the commit message and version.

As you can see, it is a pretty involved process and even 100 bugs will
take several hours manually, but if someone has the time it would be
incredibly helpful.  It doesn't need samba coding skills, just
patience!

Long term I think we really need a bot doing this, watching git and
closing bugs in real time.

[1] The way I got that list is to go to:

https://bugzilla.samba.org/query.cgi?bug_id=1%202&bug_id_type=anyexact&bug_status=NEW&bug_status=ASSIGNED&bug_status=REOPENED&f1=assigned_to&list_id=22106&o1=notequals&query_format=advanced&v1=kseeger%40samba.org

Then edit the comma-separated bug list to be the output of:

git log | grep "BUG: https://bugzilla.samba.org/show_bug.cgi?id=" | cut -f 2 -d =| sort | uniq| grep -v maybe| xargs echo | tr " " ","
