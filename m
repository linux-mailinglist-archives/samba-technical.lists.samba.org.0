One advantage of the current bootstrap system is that as long as nobody
deletes the CI images that are built, the existing images remain a
stable snapshot.  It is 'just' the bootstrap scripts that break for
others, and of course building a new image now becomes more difficult.
Â 
It is particularly sad that the end-user use of the bootstrap script
could become less reproducible, that was a really nice feature.

I'm assuming that, in the space of a few years another CentOS
replacement will grow up into this same space, rebuilding the SRPMS of
a specific RHEL release, but in the meantime this is going to be
awkward...

Of course I must say I greatly appreciate the efforts put in by Red Hat
and Red Hat's staff to building this ecosystem to which we have enjoyed
for so long.  

Thanks,

Andrew Bartlett
