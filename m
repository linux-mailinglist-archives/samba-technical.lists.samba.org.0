Tools will not need to change one bit.

For client applications the proxy simply allows access to user's
ccaches, or (and this is a feature) allows unattended use of user's
credentials either via user's keytabs or via constrained delegation
using server credentials.

The latter two features are implemented w/o needing any changes on most
client applications (some may need minor changes to the way they invoke
APIs to be less prescriptive, but the changes are generally very
minimal and straightforward).

For the latter two feature the proxy also offers privilege separation,
by handing to user processes an encrypted ccache, and intercepting
GSSAPI calls (via libgssapi mechglue, hence transparent to
applciations).

The latter.

You can use the KEYRING ccacche type if you want, or you can use the
KCM daemon, or as I said above you could use the gss-proxy privsep
feature. IT really is up to distro defaults/admin preference/choice.

Currently GSS-Proxy handles only Krb5, but extending it to cover GSS-
NTLMSSP is trivial.
PKU2U would need to be implemented by the krb5 mechanism, but we've
never seen any real demand for that.

PKU2U is not supported in any library available, so that work would
need to be done there first.

Just to be clear, GSS-Proxy does not implement any mecahnism directly,
It is a mechglue layer used to "proxy" a mechanism so that execution
happens in another context, it still uses libkrb5/libgssapi internally,
so any support needs to be implemented there first.

No, what you are looking for is for Samba to use libgssapi instead of
re-implementing most of it on it's own. GSS-Proxy is a GSSAPI mechanism
fundamentally.

GSS-Proxy is 2 things:

- A GSSAPI daemon for the kernel so you do not need to implement GSS or
krb5 in there. In this sense it could definitely do that for
cifs.ko/cifsd, as *all* GSSAPI processing is deferred to the proxy, the
kernel only shuffles the blobs of data from kernel to userspace using a
gssapi-like interface implemented via RPC (XDR encoding).
If you look at knfsd you will see zero gssapi work in the kernel.

- A privilege separation daemon so you can allow an app to use GSSAPIwithout having access to "naked" keytabs, via interposing the krb5
mechanism. At the moment, SPNEGO is *entirely* handled in libgssapi,
as it is a meta-mechanism.
So for userspace applications GSS-Proxy (and libgssapi's mechglue
layer)  would need to be changed to intercept SPNEGO, and change the
list of mechanisms available, and then hope the application doesn't
make assumptions about those mechanisms ... in practice it will always
be easier to simply provide a gssapi mechanism (you can provide them as
shared objects and load them into GSSAPI at runtime via
/etc/gss/mech.d/*.conf files, Which is how gssproxy and gss-ntlmssp are
loaded into MIT's libgssapi).

Note that for the kernel case, given the protocol is used directly even
SPNEGO can be easily proxied, so the capabalities for user-space and
kernel are slightly different at this time.

HTH,
Simo.

The former uses a custom upcall interface to talk to cifs.spnego from cifs-utils. The latter then goes looking for Kerberos ticket caches using libkrb5 functions, not GSSAPI, which prevents gssproxy from interacting with it.[2]
