How do you test for something that works on some computers, but not on 
others ?

Which is correct, it working, or it not working ?

If you have a problem with the test, take it up with Andrew, I initially 
created the script following his advice, he later 'improved' it, 
obviously not enough ;-)

Anyway, NACK to your patch, but only because you haven't remove the 
'import samba' line.
