I guess the reason for making the lease key per path on
the client is that the client can't know about possible hardlinks
before opening the file, but that open wants to use a leasekey...
Or a "stat" open that won't any lease needs to be done first,
which doubles the roundtrip for every open.

And hard links are not that common...

Maybe choosing und using a new leasekey would be the
way to start with and when a hardlink is detected
the open on the hardlink is closed again and retried
with the former lease key, which would also upgrade it again.

But sharing the handle lease for two pathnames seems wrong,
as the idea of the handle lease is to cache the patchname on the client.

While sharing the RW lease between two hardlinks would be desired.
