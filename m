Two corrections to the account below:

1. For cross-build, it's been necessary to add 
--bundled-libraries='!asn1_compile,!compile_et' regardless of whether or 
not one sets COMPILE_ET / ASN_COMPILE (i.e. there's only one method, and 
setting COMPILE_ET can be used to override the lookup for compile_et 
program in the path).

2. Consequently, cross-building is broken without workaround in 4.11 - 
the patch in this thread can be used until this gets fixed.

Thanks,
Uri.
