Great, that sounds like a way forward!  I've found this script, which
while unmaintained might be a good place to start: 
https://github.com/gera/gitzilla

Could you have a look at that and see if it is viable?

I agree for huge numbers.  Thankfully printing the git commit (bonus
for a version) and not closing it would be a great start, and is pretty
harmless. 

Also with that much done a human or humans can review what is actually
only 100 bugs much faster, so there is hope we could even close them
manually.

I agree, default assignees are essentially pointless for the way we
work.

Thanks for putting thought into this!
