The way I used it last was to run it in docker,Â  that way at least as
well you are sure you are on the same page as Andreas with respect to
any error messages etc. (and you know you don't need to set up anything
extra :-)) you can find the details of the docker image you need in the
job output above (there probably is a way to see what images are
available from the gitlab/samba project registry but I don't know how)

docker pull
registry.gitlab.com/samba-team/devel/samba/samba-ci-fedora29:b4dc3f0b446dbdc20779ae2090de0f5c0da9caef

docker images # which should show something like

REPOSITORY TAG IMAGE ID CREATED SIZE
registry.gitlab.com/samba-team/devel/samba/samba-ci-fedora29
b4dc3f0b446dbdc20779ae2090de0f5c0da9caef 85af60d25c85 4 days ago 1.32GB


you can then use the image id with to attach to it

docker run -it 85af60d25c85

inside the container you can clone samba git repo and csbuild is
available for you
