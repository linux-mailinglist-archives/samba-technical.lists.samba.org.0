SambaXP 2020 - Online Edition

The 19th International Conference for the open source software Samba
will take place from 26th - 28th May 2020 as an *free* online event. The
planned IO-Lab is cancelled.

SambaXP is the annual meeting of the international Samba team with
developers, users, manufacturers and system integrators within the Samba
ecosystem, which has been held since 2002.
Due to the current COVID-19 situation and the associated travel and
meeting restrictions, this year's conference unfortunately cannot take
place at the usual venue in GÃ¶ttingen. Therefore the organizing
committee is planning a digital edition of the popular conference for
this year.

The speakers will give their presentations live from their desks, so
that participants can follow the conference from anywhere in the world
via the Internet. Compared to the usual event format, the online event
offers even more flexibility: It is easier to switch between tracks
running in parallel or even follow two presentations at the same time.
The event is recorded with consent of the speakers and will be available
online after the conference.

The traditional tutorial by Stefan Kania will also be held as a webinar
on the day before the conference (Tuesday, 25 May 2020). This year's
topic: "Clustering with CTDB".

The IO-Lab, which is planned for the first time in the context of this
year's SambaXP unfortunately cannot take place due to the current
circumstances.

You can find all the latest information and the registration form at
https://sambaxp.org.
The organizing committee is available for questions at loc@sambaXP.org.

We are looking forward to a digital SambaXP 2020 and would like to thank
the sponsors Google and Microsoft.

Stay healthy!

Cheers,
Karolin
