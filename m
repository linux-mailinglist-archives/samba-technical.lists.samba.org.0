Hi Michael, I think you may be over thinking this ;-)

It is my understanding that the tests are designed to test the entire 
Samba suite at compile time. It is this way to ensure that changes do 
not break something else. Some tests are expected to succeed, while 
others are expected to fail, it is when a test does something that it 
isn't expected to do that you get errors.

You can run individual tests, but this is usually only done when 
altering an individual part of Samba, a python script for instance.

So, when the Samba tarball gets to you, you can be fairly sure that 
Samba is correct. Any errors, after you compile Samba and create debs 
from it, are likely to be packing errors, perhaps you need your own 
tests for that ?

I see no use in packing the tests (if this is what you are trying to 
do), they are really only of use at compile time.

This is my understanding of the tests, if it is wrong, I am sure someone 
will jump in and correct my errors.

Rowland
