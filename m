Why? Sorry, but I don't understand why you want to do that. Once we have
the skiplist with failing tests, we just have to get down and dirty and
work our way through the list one item at a time.

For each item we:

- check is the *same* test already exists as a SMB2 tests

- if no: rewrite test as smb2 test

- remove smb1 test, remove entry from skip list

Am I missing something?

Thanks!
