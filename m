It was never my intention to attack anyone, I was just trying to elicit 
information.

All I did was state the facts as I saw them and ask a question based on 
the response I received, Alexander seemed to be saying that there was a 
chance that there may be a Samba AD DC on RHEL, something that I thought 
had been ruled out.

I also stated that I think it is dishonest for Fedora not to actually 
say that, from the Samba point of view, using MIT as the kdc on an AD DC 
is classed as experimental.

If I upset anyone then I apologise, this was not what I replied for. I 
initially replied to a post from Michael asking if it was a good idea to 
produce two versions of Samba, one based on MIT and one based on 
Heimdal. It sort of all kicked of from there.

Sorry

Rowland
