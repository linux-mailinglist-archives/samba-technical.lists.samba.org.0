well, I guess we need an initial list of all those tests in
selftest/skip-smb1 and  something like this

env.OPTIONS += " --mitkrb5 --exclude=${srcdir}/selftest/skip-smb1"

in selftest/wscript.

And then figure we have to figure out why they crash or hang. Once we
know that, we can fix or remove the test.

I think we need a complete list *before* doing any changes.

I guess that's just historical practice. Look at s3/selftest/tests.py,
the final else for the block that sets up the smbtorture test is

else:
    plansmbtorture4testsuite(t, "nt4_dc", '//$SERVER_IP/tmp \
       -U$USERNAME%$PASSWORD')
    plansmbtorture4testsuite(t, "ad_dc", '//$SERVER/tmp \
        -U$USERNAME%$PASSWORD')

For most tests this is not needed and it bloats your list of failing tests.

Just remember to come back to me when you start working on this.
Hopefully by then I know what's going on.
