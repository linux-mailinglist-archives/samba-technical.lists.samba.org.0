I expect that RHEL will become free (as in gratis) for CI system at
least for Open Source projects[1], so we should not have these problems
either, nor a need for a rebuild, we should be able to use the "real
thing", I hope.

Also note that for cloud images UBI[2] is already free, and can be used
now (but there are still some problem, being worked on, wrt -devel
packages afaik).

Quote from [1]: "In the first half of 2021, we plan to introduce low-
or no-cost programs for a variety of use cases, including options for
open source projects and communities and expansion of the Red Hat
Enterprise Linux Developer subscription use cases to better serve the
needs of systems administrators. Weâ€™ll share more details as these
initiatives coalesce."
