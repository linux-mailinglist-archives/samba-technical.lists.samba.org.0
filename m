That is all well and good, but the way this is playing out here is
really awful.

It would be one thing if somebody, perhaps you, came to our project
politely suggesting 'have you considered the benefits of'...

The process here is just rubbing everyone up the wrong way.

Samba was one of the earliest projects to take up the DCO, at a time
well before it was claimed to be the semi-proprietary special thing -
it was (and still is) just a lump of text from SubmittingPatches (now
another file, but the point remains) in the kernel, modified to our
needs.  

Is our DCO perfect?  Certainly not!

Should we put a GPLv2 or other appropriate licence on it?  Sure that
would be proper and polite, but this thread feels like being bullied
around, which evokes responses like that seen from Rowland.

But right now this whole thing is getting everybodyâ€™s back up, which
isn't helping anything.
