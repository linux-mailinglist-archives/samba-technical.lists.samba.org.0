Hi Shilpa, not sure about the NDR part of this but you say that once the 
cache expires, everything works again, but you have problems for about 
30 minutes and that you have 'winbind cache time = 1800' set in 
smb.conf. Are you aware that 1800 / 60 equals '30' ? Try removing that 
line and revert to 5 mins cache, it might just fix your problem üòÅ
