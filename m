Not really.  FreeIPA isn't Samba, and it isn't my primary concern, and
so I would suggest that some things are perhaps best handled on the
FreeIPA side of the fence, where you maintain the module anyway.

Now of course it is your concern, and I look in equal parts wonder and
horror at the way Samba is used in FreeIPA, which is why I'm asking for
feedback, because FreeIPA (and apparently NAS internals) clearly isn't
my area.

The supported replacement of the Samba NT4 DC is the Samba AD DC.  

As pdb_ldap is outside of FreeIPA's use case it seems to me that there
is very little maintenance of this code, and so while it seems we will
kick this can down the road a little longer, the costs to maintain this
stack will continue to come back at us.

Thanks for your feedback, that is very interesting.  This is why we
raise such things on the mailing list.

I look forward to seeing the tests!
