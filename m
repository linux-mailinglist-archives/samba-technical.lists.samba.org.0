For the list, some of the discussion is happening on:

https://gitlab.com/samba-team/samba/-/merge_requests/2014
We are really close.  Probably not close enough to drop for 4.15 (we
may have missed something, and last-moment isn't when to drop in
something like this) but quite close, and starting the 4.16 development
cycle would give plenty of time to shake out bugs. 

There are more tests to write, but also at some point we are going to
need to just say 'this is good enough and sort the rest out in master'
as rebasing on both Samba and Heimdal takes time, care and energy.Â 

To be clear, I won't get in the way if you want to move faster, I've
just been trying to stay as careful as I thought you would be expecting
me to be (if that makes any sense).

I do suggest we should keep a fairly 'dirty' history with the previous
merge points working as much as possible, in case we need to bisect
back on bugs, to at least have some reference points.  Not our usual
practice but for this one case I think worthwhile.

We now have a mostly-working branch of current Heimdal on current
Samba, compiling on all our supported system, which is pretty
impressive.
